Meditation App Redesign – Task 3 (UI/UX Internship)

For Task 3 of my internship, I chose to redesign the onboarding/login screen of a meditation app. The goal was to create a welcoming, peaceful, and user-friendly interface that aligns with the calming essence of meditation while also improving user experience.

The first thing I implemented was the visual theme. I wanted to instantly connect users with a sense of calmness and serenity, so I included a featured image of a girl meditating, which I sourced from Pinterest. This image sets the tone for the app by visually conveying the purpose of the application – inner peace, mindfulness, and mental well-being. The use of a real person in a meditative pose also adds emotional depth and relatability to the interface, helping users feel more engaged from the moment they open the app.

Next, I designed the login screen layout. At the center of the interface is a prominent “Login” button, clearly distinguishable with a soft but readable color. I ensured the button design followed modern UI guidelines—rounded corners, balanced spacing, and high contrast for visibility.

Beneath the login button, I included two input fields: one for the email address and one for the password. These fields are placed with enough padding and visual balance to ensure ease of use. I kept the field design minimal, with subtle placeholders and soft outlines that maintain the overall gentle aesthetic of the meditation theme.

To add functionality and improve user experience, I included a “Forgot Password?” link just below the password field. This is a common but essential UX component that allows users to recover access without frustration. I kept the link small but clearly legible, usually in a different shade or underlined style to differentiate it from other text.

Finally, at the bottom of the screen, I placed a “Sign Up” option for new users who do not have an account yet. This placement follows standard design practices, making it easy for first-time users to find and initiate account creation. The text is subtle but emphasized just enough to catch the user’s attention without overshadowing the login flow.

In terms of typography, I chose clean, sans-serif fonts that reflect calmness and simplicity. The entire layout follows a vertical flow to guide the user step by step. The color palette is composed of soft pastels—lavender, sky blue, and muted whites—which enhance the overall sense of tranquility and focus.

This redesign improves the usability of the meditation app by providing a structured, visually pleasing, and emotionally engaging user interface. The layout ensures that all important actions are easy to find and interact with, making it a better experience for both returning users and newcomers.

Overall, I focused on simplicity, clarity, and emotional connection through visuals and layout. This task allowed me to practice core UI/UX principles such as user-centered design, accessibility, and visual harmony, all within a calm and serene app environment.
